* In this project, I'm developing an online shop that sales high quality Watches.
* Here, visitors can sign in or register via email and buy any Watches they want by providing necessary information.
* While signed in, a customer can cancel any order they have placed earlier from the user dashboard. A customer can add review of the service as well.
* While signed in, a admin can cancel/approve any order, add new product, delete existing products. If a user is admin then he/she can make another person as admin.
* For user authentication I'm using Firebase.
* And I've used React.js, React bootstrap, React router, Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB.
